Dobbie.live for Minecraft
====================

Integrate Twitch chat into your Minecraft. Write your own conditions and
execute your own commands (and even JavaScript code!)

Supported platforms
-------------------
[Spigot (Bukkit)](https://spigotmc.org/) and
[Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) are currently supported.
[Forge](https://www.minecraftforge.net/),
[Sponge](https://www.spongepowered.org/), and (possibly)
[NukkitX](https://nukkitx.com/) support are on their way.
There are also plans to support standalone version that could
execute commands outside of the Minecraft.

You can request a new platform support or check progress on an
upcoming ones using
[issues](https://github.com/dobbie-live/dobbie-minecraft/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Anewplatform).

We aim to support latest Minecraft version (currently 1.15.2),
but Dobbie can be ported to an older (or newer) version
relatively easily. Create an
[issue](https://github.com/dobbie-live/dobbie-minecraft/issues)
to let me know that you
need that!

How can I use it?
-----------------
Actually, for now you should probably
[contact me](https://j0x0f.dev) (j0x0f)
to make everything work.
[Documentation](https://docs.dobbie.live/?ref=github)
is not yet ready :(

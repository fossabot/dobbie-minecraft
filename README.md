Dobbie for Minecraft
====================

Integrate Twitch chat into your Minecraft. Write your own conditions and
execute your own commands (and even JavaScript code!)

[Spigot (Bukkit)](https://spigotmc.org/) and
[Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) are currently supported.
[Forge](https://www.minecraftforge.net/),
[Sponge](https://www.spongepowered.org/), and (possibly)
[NukkitX](https://nukkitx.com/) support are on their way.
